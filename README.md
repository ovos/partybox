# partybox

a meteor application we came up with at an internal hackathon. 
create a room, invite friends and have some fun with ovos partybox!

Description
------------

The ovos partybox is a simple little online game we built during an internal hackathon in a few hours.
We used Meteor and didn't really take care of validation, testing etc. since we just wanted to do a quick prototype.

Feel free to send in PRs, ideas, issues etc!

-----
